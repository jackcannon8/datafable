      <strong>DataFable.io</strong> was born from a simple belief: the best insights don’t live in spreadsheets — they live in stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use data analysis, visualization, and narrative to help people understand complex topics in policy, tech, and society. Our mission is to empower learners, leaders, and communities to find truth and meaning in data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're here to explore data journalism, policy briefings, or student-led research, you're part of a growing community that believes numbers have heart.
